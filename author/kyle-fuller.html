      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Hello and welcome to my new website. Its been a long time since I have had a
fully working website, this time I hope to maintain and update this regularly.</p>
<p>The design is heavily inspired by <a href="http://www.playgroundblues.com/">Nathan
Borrow</a>, ever since I first saw his website, I
loved how simple and white it looked. I have tried to make my website quite
different, but it always goes back to a similar look and feel that <a href="http://www.playgroundblues.com/">Nathan
Borrow</a> has on his site.</p>
<h3>What can you find here?</h3>
<p>On my website you can find various projects I am working on such as:
<a href="https://github.com/kylef/pyppp">PyPPP</a>. I am also working on
<a href="https://github.com/kylef/lithium">lithium</a> which is the batteries that wern't
included in Django, it is a suite of applications for writing a Django website,
it includes a blog, a forum, and many other useful applications.</p>
<p>The blog on my website is mainly as a home to post updates and notifications
based on the projects I am working on, I will also post anything interesting I
find in Python or Django.</p>

      <h1><a href="http://kylefuller.co.uk/posts/how-does-browserid-work/" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to How does BrowserID work?">How does BrowserID work?</a></h1>

      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>This article will explain how cryptography behind BrowserID works, and lightly
cover why BrowserID is a better alternative to OpenID.</p>
<p>A website will ask your browser for a BrowserID assertion via JavaScript.
This will either use a native BrowserID API in your browser, or it will use
the JavaScript implementation of BrowserID. This is known as the user agent.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">navigator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">gotAssertion</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For supporting browsers, the user agent will be supplied and the
<cite>navigator.id.get</cite> method will exist. The user agent can be provided by either
the browser, an extension to the browser, or via a JavaScript include on the
website to use a JavaScript implementation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://browserid.org/include.js&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This means that a browser or browser extension can provide their own
implementation, or a JavaScript implementation can be used in unsupported
browsers.</p>
<p>Out of the process, once the browser has an assertion. It will provide the
assertion to the <cite>gotAssertion</cite> callback. The website can then provide this
back to the web server to validate the assertion to confirm the user's identity.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-an-assertion">
<h2>What is an assertion?</h2>
<p>An assertion is a string which holds a JSON structure including an identity
assertion and an identity certificate. The assertion will be generated by the
browser for an identity, the browser will need to get an identity certificate
from a provider to ensure they own that identity. This identity can be used
again and again until it expires.</p>
<div class="section" id="identity-certificate">
<h3>Identity certificate</h3>
<p>An identity certificate will look like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;iss&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;kylefuller.co.uk&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;exp&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;1313971280961&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;public-key&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;principal&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;email&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;inbox@kylefuller.co.uk&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The &quot;iss&quot; field will include the domain of the issuer. The code checking the
assertion should verify that is either the domain used in the email address, or
a trusted fallback provider, such as <cite>browserid.org</cite>. This means that either
the domain providing your email address or <cite>browserid.org</cite> can provide a valid
identity certificate for your email.</p>
<p>The fallback provider will allow you to use that provider instead of your email
provider in the situation that your email provider does not support BrowserID.</p>
<p>The above identity certificate signed by the issuer, and their certificate
should be available over HTTPS at <cite>https://iss/.well-known/browserid</cite>.</p>
<p>The public key in the identity certificate is the public key of the user. This
key can be generated by the browser so only the user will have control over it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="identity-assertion">
<h3>Identity assertion</h3>
<p>The identity assertion is the final piece in a BrowserID assertion. It will be
signed by the browser's private key, so it will match the public key in the
identity certificate which our provider has confirmed we own.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;exp&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">1320280579437</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;aud&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;https://demand-browserid.herokuapp.com&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The identity assertion provides an expiry and an audience. The identity
assertion allows a website to confirm the assertion is meant for them, the
audience should be the website that we want to sign-in to.</p>
<p>The relying party which the user is identifying to should check both the
identity certificate and the identity assertion to check the certificates
match, and that neither has expired. If these are valid assertions for our
audience, then we can confirm the user owns the email address and in the
identity certificate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-use-browserid-whats-wrong-with-openid">
<h2>Why use BrowserID, whats wrong with OpenID?</h2>
<p>There are many benefits of BrowserID over OpenID.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>BrowserID is far simpler to use than OpenID for an average user. It is also
quicker, since you do not need to type your OpenID into each site.</li>
<li>When you sign-in to a site using OpenID, your OpenID provider knows you are
visiting that site. With BrowserID, your BrowserID provider is not aware of
the site you are visiting since your assertion is created in the browser. You
have already retrieved your identity certificate from the provider. Your
privacy is protected with BrowserID.</li>
<li>BrowserID uses an email address, any existing site will already have your
email address. This would allow a site to start using BrowserID without
requiring you to provide any additional information.</li>
</ul>

      <h1><a href="http://kylefuller.co.uk/posts/how-install-irssi-dreamhost/" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to How to install irssi on Dreamhost">How to install irssi on Dreamhost</a></h1>

      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>This was a useful guide I wrote back on my old website. I was trying to install irssi, and I couldn't remember how I installed it last time. Luckily it was available on archive.org's <a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">WayBackMachine</a>. I have updated this guide to glib-2.19.8 and irssi-0.8.15.</p>
<p>To install irssi, you can eigher follow the next 7 steps and install from source.</p>
<p>Every command on this page should be entered into a SSH Prompt on DreamHost</p>
<h3>SSH into your Dreamhost server (for me, this is titan.dreamhost.com, you can find your server inside <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/">panel</a>)</h3>
<h3>Create the necessary directories:</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>mkdir -p bin lib tmp
chmod 700 bin lib tmp
</pre></div>


<h3>Adding lines to your ~/.bash_profile</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/lib/pkgconfig&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib:/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</pre></div>


<h3>Activate the new changes</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bash_profile
</pre></div>


<h3>Download, untar, and install glib</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/tmp
wget ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/glib/2.19/glib-2.19.8.tar.gz
tar -xvzf glib-2.19.8.tar.gz
<span class="nb">cd </span>glib-2.19.8
./configure --prefix<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>
make
make install
</pre></div>


<h3>Download and install irssi</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/tmp
wget http://irssi.org/files/irssi-0.8.15.tar.gz
tar -xvvzf irssi-0.8.15.tar.gz
<span class="nb">cd </span>irssi-0.8.15
./configure --prefix<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>
make
make install
</pre></div>


<h3>Clean up</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>rm -rf ~/tmp/glib-2.19.8.tar.gz ~/tmp/glib-2.19.8 ~/tmp/irssi-0.8.15.tar.gz ~/tmp/irssi-0.8.15
</pre></div>


<p>Once you have installed it, simply type <code>irssi</code> to run it.</p>
<p>I asked Dreamhost if they would allow the use of a terminal application running
all the time. Here is their response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You won’t be in “trouble” for running an irc program (no servers) on our
servers. However if the system becomes unstable, it would likely be one of
the first processes killed by our admins as our servers are meant for hosting
web pages only. In general , we just don’t want users running bots or their
own server daemons on our servers.”</p>

      <h1><a href="http://kylefuller.co.uk/posts/monitoring-inspircd-mrtg/" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Monitoring InspIRCd with MRTG">Monitoring InspIRCd with MRTG</a></h1>

      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>This guide will show you how to configure MRTG to show statistics from an
InspIRCd IRC server, this will include user counts and channel counts. This
guide assumes you already have InspIRCd and MRTG setup and working. You can see
an example of this working at <a href="http://hydra.sector5d.org/">Sector 5D</a>.</p>
<h3>InspIRCd config</h3>
<p>First, you will need to configure InspIRCd to use the <code>m_http</code> and
<code>m_http_stats</code> module. I configure InspIRCd to listen on localhost and port
8081 with SSL, but you could pick any port you want, just remember to change
the <code>$address</code> variable inside <code>inspircd-stats.sh</code> later.</p>
<p>Note, the following config is for InspIRCd 2.0, if you use a older version you
may need to change the bind line to a http line, please see the InspIRCd wiki
for using a older version.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;module</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;m_httpd.so&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;module</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;m_httpd_stats.so&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;bind</span> <span class="na">address=</span><span class="s">&quot;localhost&quot;</span> <span class="na">port=</span><span class="s">&quot;8081&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;httpd&quot;</span> <span class="na">ssl=</span><span class="s">&quot;gnutls&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Once you have placed this in your InspIRCd config, you can rehash or reload
InspIRCd and then you will be able to connect to it over http(s) to retrive
stats. Such as at https://localhost:8081/stats</p>
<h4>Creating a script to gather the user or channel count on InspIRCd</h4>
<p>The following script queries the InspIRCd <code>m_httpd_stats</code> module for the user
or channel count. This depends on <a href="http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/">XMLStarlet</a>
(<a href="http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=xmlstarlet">Debian package</a>, <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=20101">Arch
AUR Package</a>), so please
install this first.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>

<span class="nv">address</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://localhost:8081/stats&quot;</span>
<span class="nv">count_type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$1</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$count_type&quot;</span> !<span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;user&quot;</span>  <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$count_type&quot;</span> !<span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;channel&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span>; <span class="k">then</span>
<span class="k">  </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Usage: $0 &lt;user|channel&gt;&quot;</span>
  <span class="nb">exit </span>1
<span class="k">elif</span>

<span class="nv">count</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>wget -q -Y off -O - --no-check-certificate <span class="nv">$address</span> | xml sel -t -v <span class="s2">&quot;inspircdstats/general/${count_type}count&quot;</span><span class="k">)</span>

<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$count</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$count</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;IRC $count_type&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This script will need to be available from the user which you run MRTG as. I
have placed mine in <code>/usr/local/bin/inspircd-stats.sh</code> but you could place it
somewhere like <code>$HOME/bin/inspircd-stats.sh</code>.</p>
<p>To download and install this to /usr/local/bin run the following:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo wget https://raw.github.com/gist/1042604/b19a4cfd91b6956063d962c977f3d5f8e3318d7d/inspircd-stats.sh -O /usr/local/bin/inspircd-stats.sh
sudo chmod+x /usr/local/bin/inspircd-stats.sh
</pre></div>


<p>Now you have this <code>inspircd-stats.sh</code> script, you can use it to get the user
and channel count as follows:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>/usr/local/bin/inspircd-stats.sh user
/usr/local/bin/inspircd-stats.sh channel
</pre></div>


<h3>MRTG Config</h3>
<p>You will need to add the following to your mrtg config file, this could be
located at <code>/etc/mrtg.cfg</code>, but this depends on how you setup mrtg.</p>

<p>Now, you can run your MRTG command for your config or wait for the MRTG cron

      <h1><a href="http://kylefuller.co.uk/posts/organising-dotfiles-in-a-git-repository/" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Organising dotfiles in a git repository">Organising dotfiles in a git repository</a></h1>

      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Organising dotfiles can be done in numerous ways. Many dotfile repositories
often have their own clunky script to copy or symbolically link their dotfiles
in place. I feel this is a dirty approach and I prefer my files to be easily
manageable via the git command. I don't want to have to copy a file every time
I change it.</p>
<img alt="/static/images/dotfiles.png" class="align-center" src="/static/images/dotfiles.png" style="width: 589px; height: 276px;" />
<p>Another approach I have seen done, is making your whole home directory a git
repository. Unfortunately after using this solution you will come across a
number of flaws, any repository in your home directory will now follow your
<cite>~/.gitignore</cite>. I also came into many problems when I was using Xcode which
will try to git add projects into your dotfiles repository. Like symbolic
linking all my dotfiles into place, this solution also felt clunky.</p>
<p>Git allows you to seperate the work tree and the git dir via environment
variables or arguments to the git command. This allows us to store the bare git
dir in <cite>~/.files.git</cite> while still keeping our entire home directory as the work
tree for git.</p>
<p>I settled for using a simple alias in my <cite>.zshrc</cite> which allows me to easily use
git to manage my dotfiles. But, it is imporant to remember that the home
directory will not be seen as a git repository unless you use this alias. You
won't be able to accidentally use git commands thinking you were in another
repo, (or accidentally git add a bunch of things in a mercurial repository).</p>
<p>Here is the alias I use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">home</span><span class="o">=</span>git --work-tree<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span> --git-dir<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.files.git
</pre></div>
<p>You can use this alias just as you would use the normal git command, this
allows you to clone and init a repo. To clone a dotfiles repo, you can do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>home clone git://github.com/kylef/dotfiles.git
