      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>It's taken me nearly a year to finish my new website. I have gone through many
iterations and have finally stuck with this theme and system.</p>
<p>Instead of running my own custom Django blog, this site is now powered by
<a class="reference external" href="http://pelican.notmyidea.org/">Pelican</a>, a static site generator. I have
created numerous patches for Pelican so that it works with custom URL
structures, so none of my URL's break when I migrated to Pelican.</p>
<div class="section" id="but-this-isn-t-your-second-revision-of-the-site">
<h2>But this isn't your second revision of the site?</h2>
<p>Ok you got me, this isn't really my second version of this site. I don't know
how many revisions I have gone through, but this is the second revision to have
the same content and posts. It's my second major release of the site in a
version control system. I use a git repository for the current site which can
be found on github <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kylef/kylefuller.co.uk">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-new">
<h2>What is new?</h2>
<p>The theme for the website is completely different, I have made a new <a class="reference external" href="/about/">about
page</a>. I have lost all the comments from my old site, there was far
too much spam to port them over.</p>
