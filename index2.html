      <h1><a href="http://kylefuller.co.uk/posts/how-install-irssi-dreamhost/" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to How to install irssi on Dreamhost">How to install irssi on Dreamhost</a></h1>

      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>This was a useful guide I wrote back on my old website. I was trying to install irssi, and I couldn't remember how I installed it last time. Luckily it was available on archive.org's <a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">WayBackMachine</a>. I have updated this guide to glib-2.19.8 and irssi-0.8.15.</p>
<p>To install irssi, you can eigher follow the next 7 steps and install from source.</p>
<p>Every command on this page should be entered into a SSH Prompt on DreamHost</p>
<h3>SSH into your Dreamhost server (for me, this is titan.dreamhost.com, you can find your server inside <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/">panel</a>)</h3>
<h3>Create the necessary directories:</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>mkdir -p bin lib tmp
chmod 700 bin lib tmp
</pre></div>


<h3>Adding lines to your ~/.bash_profile</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/lib/pkgconfig&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib:/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</pre></div>


<h3>Activate the new changes</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bash_profile
</pre></div>


<h3>Download, untar, and install glib</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/tmp
wget ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/glib/2.19/glib-2.19.8.tar.gz
tar -xvzf glib-2.19.8.tar.gz
<span class="nb">cd </span>glib-2.19.8
./configure --prefix<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>
make
make install
</pre></div>


<h3>Download and install irssi</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/tmp
wget http://irssi.org/files/irssi-0.8.15.tar.gz
tar -xvvzf irssi-0.8.15.tar.gz
<span class="nb">cd </span>irssi-0.8.15
./configure --prefix<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>
make
make install
</pre></div>


<h3>Clean up</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>rm -rf ~/tmp/glib-2.19.8.tar.gz ~/tmp/glib-2.19.8 ~/tmp/irssi-0.8.15.tar.gz ~/tmp/irssi-0.8.15
</pre></div>


<p>Once you have installed it, simply type <code>irssi</code> to run it.</p>
<p>I asked Dreamhost if they would allow the use of a terminal application running
all the time. Here is their response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You won’t be in “trouble” for running an irc program (no servers) on our
servers. However if the system becomes unstable, it would likely be one of
the first processes killed by our admins as our servers are meant for hosting
web pages only. In general , we just don’t want users running bots or their
own server daemons on our servers.”</p>

      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Hello and welcome to my new website. Its been a long time since I have had a
fully working website, this time I hope to maintain and update this regularly.</p>
<p>The design is heavily inspired by <a href="http://www.playgroundblues.com/">Nathan
Borrow</a>, ever since I first saw his website, I
loved how simple and white it looked. I have tried to make my website quite
different, but it always goes back to a similar look and feel that <a href="http://www.playgroundblues.com/">Nathan
Borrow</a> has on his site.</p>
<h3>What can you find here?</h3>
<p>On my website you can find various projects I am working on such as:
<a href="https://github.com/kylef/pyppp">PyPPP</a>. I am also working on
<a href="https://github.com/kylef/lithium">lithium</a> which is the batteries that wern't
included in Django, it is a suite of applications for writing a Django website,
it includes a blog, a forum, and many other useful applications.</p>
<p>The blog on my website is mainly as a home to post updates and notifications
based on the projects I am working on, I will also post anything interesting I
find in Python or Django.</p>
