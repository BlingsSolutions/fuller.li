Title: Hello, and welcome

Slug: hello-welcome

Hello and welcome to my new website. Its been a long time since I have had a
fully working website, this time I hope to maintain and update this regularly.

The design is heavily inspired by [Nathan
Borrow](http://www.playgroundblues.com/), ever since I first saw his website, I
loved how simple and white it looked. I have tried to make my website quite
different, but it always goes back to a similar look and feel that [Nathan
Borrow](http://www.playgroundblues.com/) has on his site.

### What can you find here?

On my website you can find various projects I am working on such as:
[PyPPP](https://github.com/kylef/pyppp). I am also working on
[lithium](https://github.com/kylef/lithium) which is the batteries that wern't
included in Django, it is a suite of applications for writing a Django website,
it includes a blog, a forum, and many other useful applications.

The blog on my website is mainly as a home to post updates and notifications
based on the projects I am working on, I will also post anything interesting I
find in Python or Django.
