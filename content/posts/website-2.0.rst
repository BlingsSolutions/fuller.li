:title: Website 2.0

It's taken me nearly a year to finish my new website. I have gone through many
iterations and have finally stuck with this theme and system.

Instead of running my own custom Django blog, this site is now powered by
`Pelican <http://pelican.notmyidea.org/>`_, a static site generator. I have
created numerous patches for Pelican so that it works with custom URL
structures, so none of my URL's break when I migrated to Pelican.

But this isn't your second revision of the site?
------------------------------------------------

Ok you got me, this isn't really my second version of this site. I don't know
how many revisions I have gone through, but this is the second revision to have
the same content and posts. It's my second major release of the site in a
version control system. I use a git repository for the current site which can
be found on github `here <https://github.com/kylef/kylefuller.co.uk>`_.

What is new?
------------

The theme for the website is completely different, I have made a new `about
page </about/>`_. I have lost all the comments from my old site, there was far
too much spam to port them over.
