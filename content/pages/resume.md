Title: Resume

I’m an skilled developer with experience developing software across both
open-source and commercial projects in various languages. Over the years I
have contributed to many open-source projects ranging from the popular Django
web framework to Linux kernel modules.

My focus in software development started off with server side development
building daemons and websites. After the launch of the iPhone I knew it was
the next thing. Shortly after, I fell in love with iOS and mobile development.
iOS has allowed me to craft beautiful applications with elegant and intuitive
interfaces.

I began working closely with a friend where we developed our first iOS
application where we spent most of the time trying to perfect our interface.
Later on I started working at a creative digital agency where I began building
design rich applications for our clients and collaborating closely with our
design team.

### Experience

#### Mentally Friendly (2012 - Present)
I’ve been a key member of the mobile development team at Mentally Friendly,
leading the iOS and Android teams to create high-profile mobile applications
for clients such as the Guardian, Fitness First and Soho House.

#### Cocode LTD (2012 - Present)
With Cocode, I have built up and managed a small team to design and implement
our own, design focused applications such as Palaver. Our goal is to create
highly intuitive applications and services with a solid architecture and user
interface design.

#### BestTechie Holdings, Inc (2012)
Continued development of Textual (Mac OS X Application) and maintaining the
current code-base while the lead developer was unavailable. This involved
responding to customer issues and implementing feature requests, along with
debugging and resolving issues in the existing code-base.

#### Dark Science Ltd (2012)
Designed and implemented a wiki engine along with a permissions system for
storing sensitive material in a central place. Consolidated authentication
with external web authentication mechanism called BrowserID. Along with
implementing custom DNS daemons for a automated DNS configuration.
